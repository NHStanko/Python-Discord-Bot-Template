## How to set up

To set up the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.json](config.json) file where you can put the
needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable                  | What it is                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YOUR_BOT_PREFIX_HERE      | The prefix you want to use for normal commands                        |
| YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE       | The token of your bot                                                 |
| YOUR_BOT_PERMISSIONS_HERE | The permissions integer your bot needs when it gets invited           |
| YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE  | The application ID of your bot                                        |
| OWNERS                    | The user ID of all the bot owners                                     |


## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows), or your Command Prompt (
Windows)
.

Before running the bot you will need to install all the requirements with this command:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you can start it with

```
python bot.py
```

> **Note** You may need to replace `python` with `py`, `python3`, `python3.11`, etc. depending on what Python versions you have installed on the machine.
